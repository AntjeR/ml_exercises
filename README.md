# Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains the Python exercises accompanying the theory from my [machine learning book](https://franziskahorn.de/mlbook/).

You might also want to have a look at the [cheat sheet](/cheatsheet.pdf), which includes a summary of the most important steps when developing a machine learning solution, incl. code snippets.

If you're unfamiliar with Python, please have a look at [this tutorial](https://github.com/cod3licious/python_tutorial) before working on the exercises, which also includes some notes on how to install Python and Jupyter Notebook on your own computer (please make sure you're using Python 3 and all libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file are installed and up to date; you can verify this with the `test_installation.ipynb` notebook). <br>
If you have a Google account, you can also run the code in the cloud using **Google Colab**:

If you have any questions, please drop me a line at `hey[at]franziskahorn.de`.

Have fun!
