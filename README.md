## Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains the Python exercises accompanying the theory from my [machine learning book](https://franziskahorn.de/mlbook/).

Also have a look at the [cheat sheet](https://github.com/cod3licious/ml_exercises/blob/main/cheatsheet.pdf), which includes a summary of the most important steps when developing a machine learning solution, incl. code snippets.

If you're unfamiliar with Python, please have a look at [this tutorial](https://github.com/cod3licious/python_tutorial) first, which also includes some notes on what you need to install to work on the exercises on your computer. If you have a Google account, you can also run the code in the cloud using **Google Colab**:

If you have any questions, please drop me a line at `hey[at]franziskahorn.de`.

Have fun!
