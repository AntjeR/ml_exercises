    "Large text datasets are often difficult to grasp, because it is hard to see the big picture when reading many individual texts. In this notebook, we create an interactive visualization of paragraphs from Wikipedia articles to show that exploring text datasets this way is much more fun and gives us a better overview of the data.\n",
    "The original data is from [here](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) and was modified for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the file `articles_short.json` in the data folder. The file extension `.json` stands for _JavaScript Object Notation_ and this is a common format for exchanging data online, e.g., when using third-party API services. Conveniently, this data format can be mapped 1:1 to Python data structures (i.e., nested lists and dictionaries). In our case, the file `articles_short.json` contains the texts of 100 Wikipedia articles, which are organized in a dictionary, where the key of the dict is the title of an article and the corresponding value is a list with the individual paragraphs."
